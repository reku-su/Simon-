# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Rex Miguel Tabora**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Player cannot interact with the buttons until the the clue sequence is done.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
The following resources were used to implement extra features:

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I had a few hiccups when trying to implement some of the necessary features required in this prework project. HTML, CSS, and JS are languages that I do not have much experience in yet and some of the syntax, structures, and concepts that were used and explored in this prework were a bit foreign to me, yet familiar. Some of these features in the three languages used in the prework were also present in languages that I have used before--similar to JS's ability to delay or wait, Lua also has functions that act the same way--but certain nuances in languages had them implemented in a different way. In short, I knew what I had to do, but just not the means to correctly implement it. Thankfully I did not have to look too far in trying to understand new material; the prework's references that were spread throughout the guide were what helped me understood how a function or structure behaves exactly and how to do certain things in a certain language. After consulting with the given resources, I solidified my understanding a bit more by adding some extra features to the game that were not in the included tutorial and also utilized the new concepts learned. Struggling with, completing, and making sure those features work in a language is how I strengthen my understanding of the concepts in the context of computer programming as a whole, and to also reenforce new knowledge of that concept in the specific context of the language that I was working in. I find that a lot of concepts in programming overlap in most coding languages, so I find it helpful to understand these at a conceptual level first and to put them to practice on my own.

Besides the necessary features, most of the extra features I added to this memory game included some syntax or functions that were not explained in the prework guide. As seen above, most of those outside resources were essentially used just to make sure I knew how to implement these extra features programmatically and what functions to use. As computer scientists, it helps to be resourceful when trying to solve problems and I believe that consulting outside resources is something that you have to do every now and then. I definitely would not have been able to implement the extra features without the help of other resources. Most of the time we'll be working in groups or teams on a single project, and I believe there are appropriate times where it is fine to ask help from other things or people. You won't know everything on the job, but you can learn efficiently if you are resourceful.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

The only question I have about web development is, how can we take it more steps further? After completing the required steps for this prework, I started wondering how to make the website and game more friendly to the player, mainly in how the game looks. I started wondering if it was possible to add animations to the buttons that we made, or make it so that the buttons or text follow a specific format and not go to the right of the screen and wrap around endlessly. The iOS course that CodePath also offers slowly showed us how to style our iOS apps the way we want to, so I wonder if HTML lets us have that same freedom.

On the topic of making small games on websites, I also wonder how certain websites like Newgrounds embed game engine windows into their websites? I'll have to look into that one pretty soon.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

I would spend those few hours adding more user functionality to the game; the ones that come to mind are different game modes, layout theme, and perhaps adding a drop-down menu that lets you edit the number of buttons that are in the game. I am all for letting the player play how they want when it comes to games--what got me into computer science back then was building my own games as a kid--and I believe that the freedom to let the player edit however they want, atleast within the restrictions of the game's design, is top priority for a lot of these kinds of projects. I apply this philosophy a lot when it comes to websites and games; to a certain extent, these should be freely customizable by the player.

Since the prework touched a lot on web development, I would also spend a bit time touching up on visuals and adding a certain theme to the game rather than just have it as a plain memory game. Having a unique sort of style, brand, or theme, while not as involved in computer-sciency stuff as other aspects in building a project, really makes projects both personal and professional really stand out. While I did not have the full time to implement this nor did I have the complete list of assets, I was thinking of theming this memory game on another game with a short storyline to go with it. Perhaps I'll come back to this prework assignment and do so in the future.
